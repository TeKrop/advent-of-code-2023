# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for AoC 2023, written in Python (3.12). My goal is to write the most readable, understandable and maintainable solutions IMO, which are not necessarily the most performant ones.

## Usage

```
usage: main.py [-h] -d {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25} [-e]

Run the Advent of Code 2023 solution script for a given day

options:
	-h, --help            show this help message and exit
	-d {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25}, --day {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25} day of solution to run
	-e, --example         use example data instead of definitive data
```
